The only requisite knowledge is a basic understanding of algorithms and the ability to read Haskell code.\n",

    "## Boolean Constraint Satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by jumping in with an example of a constraint satisfaction problem. Suppose that you need to go grocery shopping, and need to visit three stores: Costco, Home Depot, and Walmart. Costco is open in the morning and evening, Home Depot is open in the evening only, and Walmart is open in the morning only. You can only be in one place at a time, and shopping at a given store takes up the entire morning or evening. Can you go to all three stores in a day?\n",
    "\n",
    "To a human, it is intuitively obvious that the answer is no. Since Home Depot and Walmart offer us only one time option (evening and morning, respectively), then we have to go there at those times. However, this leaves no time for a Costco trip, so it's evident that this \"puzzle\" has no solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose instead of three stores, you were given three thousand (each with its own schedule), and instead of two times, you were given all the hours of a day? At this point, the problem becomes intractable for a human. Luckily, though, cruching numbers and analyzing thousands of different options are what computers excel at.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how would you encode the above problem in a way that a computer could understand?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are built upon boolean algebra, operating on true and false values. Thus, a natural way to encode our problem is to try to rewrite it as an expression involving boolean variables, which can either be true or false. For example, using the example of three stores and two times, let's make six variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $C_e$: Whether we go to Costco in the evening.\n",
    "- $C_m$: Whether we go to Costco in the morning.\n",
    "- $H_e$: Whether we go to Home Depot in the evening.\n",
    "- $H_m$: Whether we go to Home Depot in the morning.\n",
    "- $W_e$: Whether we go to Walmart in the evening.\n",
    "- $W_m$: Whether we go to Walmart in the morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these variables if true (or 1) if we visit the store at the corresponding time, and false otherwise. Next, we form some constraints on these variables, and express them in a unified form we could feed to a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we know that we can only be in one place at a given time. For example, if we are at Costco in the morning (that is, $C_m = 1$), then we cannot be at Home Depot or Walmart in the morning (and thus $H_m = W_m = 0$). Using $\\wedge$ for \"and\", $\\vee$ for \"or\", and $\\overline{A}$ to indicate \"not $A$\", we can express that constraint as $C_m \\wedge \\overline{H_m} \\wedge \\overline{W_m}$. Note that this constraint *assumes* that $C_m = 1$; $C_m$ must be true in order to satisfy that constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we know that at a given time, we could go to Costco, Home Depot, *or* Walmart, so $C_m$ doesn't have to be true. Thus, the constraint that we only go to one place in the evening can be represented as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(C_e \\wedge \\overline{H_e} \\wedge \\overline{W_e}) \\vee (\\overline{C_e} \\wedge {H_e} \\wedge \\overline{W_e}) \\vee (\\overline{C_e} \\wedge \\overline{H_e} \\wedge {W_e})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the constraint that we only go to one place in the morning is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(C_m \\wedge \\overline{H_m} \\wedge \\overline{W_m}) \\vee (\\overline{C_m} \\wedge {H_m} \\wedge \\overline{W_m}) \\vee (\\overline{C_m} \\wedge \\overline{H_m} \\wedge {W_m})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need a constraint that we go to Costco in either the morning or evening, which we can represent as $C_m \\vee C_e$: either we go to Costco in the morning, or in the evening. We have similar constraints for Walmart and Home Depot, yielding the following constraint to represent that we must go to each store:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(C_m \\vee C_e) \\wedge (H_m \\vee H_e) \\wedge (M_m \\vee M_e)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the full set of constraints for our problem is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(C_m \\vee C_e) \\wedge (H_m \\vee H_e) \\wedge (M_m \\vee M_e) &\\wedge\\\\\n",

The formal definition of NP-completeness involves a bit of math and complexity theory. Roughly speaking, NP problems are those that we can check but not necessarily solve in polynomial time, and NP-complete problems are problems that, if we could solve them in polynomial time, we could solve any NP problem in polynomial time. Computer scientists currently do not know if P is equal to NP; that is, whether all NP problems can be solved in polynomial times. Most people believe that that isn't the case, and that NP-complete problems *cannot* be solved efficiently (in polynomial time). Since 3-SAT is NP-complete, this means that it probably can't be solved in polynomial time, and so quite possibly the exponential asymptotics of backtracking search are the best we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even if asymptotically better algorithms cannot exist, that doesn't mean we can't have algorithms that are better in practice. One such algorithm, known as the DPLL Algorithm (named after it's creators, unabbreviated as the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm), is effectively a set of heuristics that optimize our simple backtracking search. Although the DPLL algorithm was invented decades ago (in the 60s), many modern SAT solvers still use DPLL as their base, adding many algorithmic tricks, data structures, and low-level optimizations to achieve high performance.\n",

    "### Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The DPLL algorithm, unlike our backtracking search, requires that the input expressions be of a particular form, known as conjunctive normal form, or CNF. An expression is in CNF if it consists of conjunction of clauses, each of which is a disjunction of literals. In other words, we have a set of clauses; each clause consists of variables and negated variables which are all or-ed together; all the clauses are then and-ed together. For example, the expressions $A \\wedge B \\wedge (C \\vee \\overline A)$ and $(A \\vee B) \\wedge \\overline A$ are in conjunctive normal form (CNF), but the expressions $\\overline{\\overline{A}} \\vee B$ and $\\overline{A \\vee B}$ are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem at first that an algorithm that *only* works on such a restricted set of expressions is useless. Our backtracking search works on *any* bolean expression! What's the point of DPLL if it requires something in CNF?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that any boolean expression can be *converted* to CNF fairly efficiently. If we apply [De Morgan's laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws) and distribute \"or\"s over \"ands\" repeatedly, we eventually get an expression in CNF. Once we have our expression in CNF, we can feed it to DPLL.\n",
    "\n",
    "De Morgan's laws allow you to distribute negations over conjunctions (ands) and disjunctions (ors):\n",
    "- $\\overline{A \\wedge B} = \\overline{A} \\vee \\overline{B}$.\n",
    "- $\\overline{A \\vee B} = \\overline{A} \\wedge \\overline{B}$.\n",
    "Applying this repeatedly ensures that the only things inside a negation are literals like $A$ or $B$, and not compound expressions, like $A \\wedge B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributing disjunctions over conjunctions allows you to float the conjunctions to the outer layer, which we require for CNF:\n",
    "$$A \\vee (X \\wedge Y) = (A \\vee X) \\wedge (A \\vee Y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing DPLL, let's go ahead and implement that conversion. We begin by two helper functions: one which tries to apply De Morgan's laws, and one which tries to distribute an or over an and:"

    "- If there are multiple free variables available in an expression, how do we choose which one to branch on?\n",
    "- How do we decide whether we should guess true or false for a variable?\n",
    "- What data structures should we use for storing clauses, and how do we detect unit clauses and polarized literals?\n",
    "\n",
    "Accelerating SAT solving relies on answering these, and other questions, in clever ways. As mentioned before, we can't improve the *asymptotic* complexity of our algorithms by answering these questions differently, but we can improve real-world efficiency of our solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding on the next branching literal can be done in a number of ways. In our implementation, we simply used the first literal we encountered. This is not necessarily the best solution – one can imagine a situation in which the first encountered literal happens to conflict with the last chosen literal, and so if the wrong path is chosen, half the search space must be looked at before the error can be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist a number of heuristics which have been used to compute branching literals. For example, you can find the literal that is mentioned in the most clauses. By doing so, you either reduce the search space dramatically (by reducing the number of clauses and maybe variables), or you quickly reach a conflict, which means you waste less time searching through that part of the solution space. While this heuristic is pretty good, it can be fairly expensive to keep track of how many times a literal is used, especially once you have thousands or millions of variables!\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristics can also exist for the initial guess on a variable. For example, if a variable occurs more times in the negative than in the positive polarity, it may be better to guess a value of false for it before guessing true. Once again, the value of the heuristic has to be weighed against the cost of computing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last optimization worth mentioning is known as **clause learning**. Clause learning is based off two ideas. First of all, when we encounter a conflict, we can deduce what decisions we made to cause that conflict; from that, we can learn a new clause, forcing us not to make those decisions. Second, we can track which variable assignments imply other assignments, and when a conflict is reached, instead of backtracking one level higher, we can *backjump* as many levels up as necessary to fix the source of the conflict. Together, these two things allow quickly pruning large regions of the search space, dramatically increasing the number of clauses and variables SAT solvers can handle. Many modern SAT solvers are based off DPLL augmented with clause learning, yielding an algorithm known as Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)."
