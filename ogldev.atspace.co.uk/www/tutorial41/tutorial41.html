      <h3> Background </h3>

      <p>
        Motion Blur is a very popular technique in fast pace 3D games whose purpose is to add a blurring
        effect to moving objects. This enhances the sense of realism experienced by the player. Motion
        Blur can be accomplished in various ways. There is a camera based Motion Blur which focuses on
        camera movement and there is an object based Motion Blur. In this tutorial we will study one of the
        options to accomplish the later.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principle behind Motion Blur is that we can calculate the vector of movement (a.k.a Motion Vector)
        for each rendered pixel between two frames. By sampling along that vector from the current color buffer
        and averaging the result we get pixels that represent the movement of the underlying objects. This is really
        all there is to it. Let's take it to the next level of details. The following is a summary of the required
        steps and after that we will review the actual code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>The technique is split into two passes - a render pass and then a motion blur pass.</li>
          <li>In the render pass we render into two buffers - the regular color buffer and a motion vector
            buffer. The color buffer contains the original image as if it was rendered without motion blur.
            The motion vector blur contains a vector for each pixel which represents its movement along the screen
            between the previous frame and the current.</li>
          <li>The motion vector is calculated by supplying the WVP matrix of the previous frame to the VS. We transform the
            local space position of each vertex using the current WVP and the previous one to clip space and pass both results
            to the FS. We get the interpolated clip space positions in the FS and transform them to NDC by dividing them
            by their respective W coordinate. This completes their projection to the screen so now we can substract
            the previous position from the current and get a motion vector. The motion vector is written out to a texture.</li>
          <li>The motion blur pass is implemented by rendering a full screen quad. We sample the motion vector for each
            pixel in the FS and then we sample from the color buffer along that vector (starting from the current pixel).</li>
          <li>We sum up the results of each sample operation while giving the highest weight to the current pixel
            and the lowest weight to the one which is the most distant on the motion vector (this is what we do in this tutorial,
            but there are many other options here).</li>
          <li>This averaging of sample results along the motion vector creates the sense of bluriness. Obviously, pixels
            that didn't move between two frames will look the same, which is fine.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
      <p>This tutorial is based on the Skeletal Animation tutorial (#38). We will review here the changes that add
      the motion blur to that tutorial.</p>

      <p>This is our render pass. It is almost identical to the one from the Skeletal Animation tutorial
      with changes marked in bold face. The intermediate buffer is a simple class that combines the color, depth,
      and motion vector buffers under a single frame buffer object. We've seen this already when we studied deferred
      rendering (tutorials 35-37) so I'm not going to review it here. Check the attached sources. The basic idea
      is to render into a FBO and not directly to the screen. In the motion blur pass we will read from the intermediate
      buffer.</p>
      <p>
        Other than that you can see that we've added a class member to the 'Tutorial41' class that keeps the vector of bone
        transformations from the previous frame. We feed it into the skinning technique along with the current bone transformations.
        We will see how this is used when we review the GLSL code of the technique.

      }
      </code>
      <p>In the motion blur pass we bind the intermediate buffer for reading (which means that the rendering
        output goes to the screen) and render a full screen quad. Each screen pixel will be processed once
        and the effect of motion blur will be calculated.

        and substract one from the other.</p>
        <p>Note that the motion vector is just a 2D vector. This is because it "lives" only on the screen. The corresponding

      <p>This is where all the motion blur fun takes place. We sample the motion vector of the
        current pixel and use it to sample four texels from the color buffer. The color of the current
        pixel is sampled using the original texture coordinates and we give it the highest weight (0.4).
        We then move the texture coordinate backward along the motion vector and sample three more color
        texels. We combine them together while giving smaller and smaller weights as we move along.

        You can see that I divided the original motion vector by two. You will probably need some fine tuning
        here as well as with the weights to get the best result for your scene. Have fun.
