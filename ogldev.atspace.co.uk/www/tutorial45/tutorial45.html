            <h3> Background </h3>
<p>
    Do you remember how our lighting model began evolving? Back in <a href="../tutorial17/tutorial17.html">tutorial 17</a> 
    we took a first look at the lighting model, starting with the ambient lighting type. The ambient lighting
    which is supposed to mimic the general feeling of "everything is bright" that you
    get in a highly lit, mid-day environment, was implemented using a single floating point
    value that was attached to each lighting source and we multiplied that value by
    the color of the surface which we sampled from the texture bound to that surface.
    So you could have a single light source in your scene called "sun" and you could 
    play with the ambient light to control how well the scene was generally lit - values closer
    to zero produced a darker scene while values closer to 1 produced a lighter
    scene.
</p>
<p>
    In the following tutorials we implemented diffuse and specular lighting which
    contributed to the overall quality of the scene but the basic ambient light
    remained the same. In the recent years we see a rise of what is known as 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion">Ambient Occlusion</a>
    which basically means that instead of going with a fixed ambient light value
    for each pixel we can calculate how much the pixel is exposed to the ambient
    light source. A pixel on the floor in the middle of room is much more exposed
    to the light than, say, a pixel in the corner. This means that the corner will
    be a bit darker than the rest of the floor. This is the core of ambient occlusion.
    So in order to implement it we need to find a way to differentiate between those
    "tightly packed in corners pixels" vs. "out in the open pixels". The product of
    this calculation is an ambient occlusion term which will control the ambient light
    in the final lighting stage. Here's a visualization of this ambient occlusion term:
</p>
<img src = "http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial45/ao.jpg">
<p>
    You can see how the edges are the brightest and the corners where we expect
    to get the smaller amount of lighting are much darker.
</p>
<p>
    There is a lot of research on the subject of ambient occlusion and many algorithms
    have been developed to approximate it. We are going to study a branch of these algorithms
    known as <i>Screen Space Ambient Occlusion</i> or SSAO, which was developed by 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crytek">Crytek</a>
    and became highly popular with their 2007 release of <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysis">Crysis</a>.
    Many games have since implemented SSAO and a lot of variations were created 
    on top of it. We are going to study a simplified version of the algorithm based
    on a <a href="http://john-chapman-graphics.blogspot.co.il/2013/01/ssao-tutorial.html">SSAO tutorial by John Chapman</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Ambient occlusion can be very compute intensive. Crytek came up with a good compromise
    where the occlusion term is calculated once per pixel. Hence the prefix 'Screen Space'
    to the algorithm name. The idea was to go over the window pixel by pixel, extract
    the view space position in that location, sample a few random points very near that position
    and check whether they fall inside or outside the real geometry in that area. If many
    points fall inside the geometry it means the original pixel is cornered by many polygons
    and receives less light.
    If many points are outside of any geometry it means the original pixel is "highly exposed"
    and therefore receives more light. For example, take a look at the following image:
</p>
<img src="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial45/algorithm.jpg">
<p>
    We have a surface with two points on it - P0 and P1. Assume that we are looking
    at it from somewhere on the upper left corner of the image. We sample a few points
    around each point and check whether they fall inside or outside the geometry. 
    In the case of P0 there is a greater chance that random points around it will fall inside
    the geometry. For P1 it is the opposite. Therefore we expect to get a greater ambient
    occlusion term for P1 which means it will look lighter in the final frame.
</p>
<p>
    Let's take it to the next level of details. We are going to plug in an ambient occlusion
    pass somewhere before our standard lighting pass (we will need the ambient term for the
    lighting). This ambient occlusion pass will be a standard full screen quad pass where
    the calculation is done once per pixel. For every pixel we will need its view space position
    and we want to generate a few random points in close vicinity to that position. The easiest
    way will be to have a texture ready at the point fully populated with the view space
    positions of the entire scene geometry (obviously - only of the closest pixels). For
    this we will need a geometry pass before the ambient pass where something very similar
    to the gbuffer that we saw in deferred rendering will be filled with view space
    position information (and that's it - we don't need normals, color, etc). So now
    getting the view space position for the current pixel in the ambient pass is just one
    sample operation away. 
</p>
<p>
    So now we are in a fragment shader holding the view space position for the current
    pixel. Generating random points around it is very easy. We will pass into the shader
    an array of random vectors (as uniform variables) and add each one to the view space position.
    For every generated point we want to check whether it lies inside or outside the geometry.
    Remember that these points are virtual, so no match to the actual surface is expected. 
    We are going to do something very similar to what we did in shadow mapping. Compare the Z
    value of the random point to the Z value of the closest point in the actual geometry.
    Naturally, that actual geometry point must lie on the ray that goes from the camera to the virtual
    point. Take a look at the following diagram:
</p>
<img src="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial45/diagram1.jpg"</img>
<p>
    Point P lies on the red surface and the red and green points were generated randomly around it.
    The green point lies outside (before) the geometry and the red is inside (thus contributes to
    the ambient occlusion). The circle represents the radius in which random points are
    generated (we don't want them to be too far off point P). R1 and R2 are the rays from the camera
    (at 0,0,0) to the red and green points. They intersect the geometry somewhere. In order 
    to calculate the ambient occlusion we must compare the Z values of the red 
    and green points vs the Z value of the corresponding geometry points that are formed
    by the intersection of R1/R2 and the surface. We already have the Z value of the
    red and green points (in view space; after all - this is how we created them). But
    where's the Z value of the points formed by the above intersection?    
</p>
<p>
    Well, there's more than one solution to that question but since we already have a texture
    ready with the view space position of the entire scene the simplest way will be
    to find it somehow in it. To do that we will need the two texture coordinates
    that will sample the view space position for the R1 and R2 rays. Remember that the original
    texture coordinates that were used to find the view space position of P are not
    what we need. These coordinates were formed based on the interpolation of the 
    full screen quad that we are scanning in that pass. But R1 and R2 don't intersect P.
    They intersect the surface somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
    Now we need to do a quick refresher on the way the texture with the view space positions
    was originally created. After transforming the object space coordinates to view space
    the resulting vectors were multiplied by the projection matrix (in fact - all these
    transformation were performed by a single matrix). All this happened in the vertex
    shader and on the way to the fragment shader the GPU automatically performed
    perspective divide to complete the projection. This projection placed the view space
    position on the near clipping plane and the points inside the frustum have
    a (-1,1) range for their XYZ components. As the view space position was written out to
    the texture in the fragment shader (the above calculation is performed only on gl_Position; the data
    written to the texture is forwarded in a different variable) the XY were transformed
    to the (0,1) range and the results are the texture coordinates where the view space
    position is going to be written.
</p>
<p>
    So can we use the same procedure in order to calculate the texture coordinates
    for the red and green points? Well, why not? The math is the same. All we
    need to do is provide the shader with the projection matrix and use
    it to project the red and green points on the near clipping plane. We will need
    to perform the perspective divide manually but that's a no-brainer. Next we will
    need to transform the result to the (0,1) and here's our texture coordinate!
    We are now just a sample away from getting the missing Z value and checking
    whether the virtual point that we generated is located inside or outside the geometry.
    Now let's see the code.

            <h3> Source walkthru </h3>

<code>
    virtual void RenderSceneCB()<br>
    {   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;        m_pGameCamera->OnRender();      <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;         BlurPass();<br>

        <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         OgldevBackendSwapBuffers();<br>
    }    
</code>
<p>
    We will start the source walkthru from the top level and work our way down. This is the main
    render loop and in addition to the three passes that we discussed in the
    background section there's also a blur pass whose job is to apply a blur
    kernel on the ambient occlusion map formed by the SSAO pass. This helps smooth
    things up a bit and is not part of the core algorithm. It's up to you to decide
    whether to include it or not in your engine.
</p>
<p>(tutorial45.cpp:177)</p>
<code>
    void GeometryPass()<br>
    {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 	m_geomPassTech.Enable();        <br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         m_gBuffer.BindForWriting();<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         m_pipeline.Orient(m_mesh.GetOrientation());<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         m_geomPassTech.SetWVP(m_pipeline.GetWVPTrans());        <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 	m_geomPassTech.SetWVMatrix(m_pipeline.GetWVTrans());<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         m_mesh.Render();       <br>
    }    
</code>
<p>
    In the geometry pass we render the entire scene into a texture. In this
    example there's only one mesh. In the real world there will probably
    be many meshes.

{       <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     gl_Position = gWVP * vec4(Position, 1.0);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     ViewPos     = (gWV * vec4(Position, 1.0)).xyz;<br>
}

layout (location = 0) out vec3 PosOut;   <br>
<br>
void main()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     PosOut = ViewPos;<br>
}
</code>
<p>
These are the vertex and fragment shaders of the geometry pass. In the vertex shader
we calculate the gl_position as usual and we pass the view
space position to the fragment shader in a separate variable. Remember that there is no perspective
divide for this variable but it is a subject to the regular interpolations performed
during rasterization.
</p>
<p>
    In the fragment shader we write the interpolated view space position to the 
    texture. That's it.
</p>
<p>(tutorial45.cpp:192)</p>
<code>
    void SSAOPass()<br>
    {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         m_SSAOTech.Enable();<br>
        <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         m_SSAOTech.BindPositionBuffer(m_gBuffer);<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         m_aoBuffer.BindForWriting();<br>
        <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         m_quad.Render();<br>
    }   
</code>
<p>
This is the application code of the SSAO pass and it is very simple. On the
input side we have the view space position from the previous pass and
we write the output to an AO buffer. For the rendering we use a full screen quad.
This will generate the AO term for every pixel. The real meat is in the shaders.
</p>
<p>(ssao.vs)</p>
<code>
    #version 330<br>
<br>
layout (location = 0) in vec3 Position; <br>
<br>
out vec2 TexCoord;<br>
<br>
void main()<br>
{          <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; gl_Position = vec4(Position, 1.0);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; TexCoord = (Position.xy + vec2(1.0)) / 2.0;<br>
}
</code>
<p>
As in many screen space based techniques in the vertex shader we just need to
pass-thru the position of the full screen quad. gl_Position will be consumed
by the GPU for the purposes of rasterization but we use it's XY components for
the texture coordinates. Remember that the full screen quad coordinates
range from (-1,-1) to (1,1) so everything in the fragment shader will be interpolated 
in that range. We want our texture coordinates to be in the (0,1) so we transform
it here before sending it out to the fragment shader.

 <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     FragColor = vec4(pow(AO, 2.0));<br>
}    
</code>
<p>
Here's the core of the SSAO algorithm. We take the texture coordinates
we got from the vertex shader and sample the position map to fetch our view space position. Next we
enter a loop and start generating random points. This is done using an array of
uniform vectors (gKernel). This array is populated by random vectors in the
(-1,1) range in the ssao_technique.cpp file (which I haven't included here because it's pretty
standard; check the code for more details). We now need to find the texture coordinates
that will fetch the Z value for the geometry point that matches the current random point.
We project the random point from view space on the near clipping plane using the projection matrix, perform perspective divide on
it and transform it to the (0,1) range. We can now use it to sample the view space position
of the actual geometry and compare its Z value to the random point. But before we do
that we make sure that the distance between the origin point and the one whose Z value
we just fetched is not too far off. This helps us avoid all kinds of nasty artifacts.
You can play with the gSampleRad variable for that. 
</p>
<p>
Next we compare the depth of the virtual point with the one from the actual
geometry. The GLSL step(x,y) function returns 0 if y < x and 1 otherwise.
This means that the local variable AO increases as more points end up behind the geometry.
We plan to multiply the result by the color of the lighted pixel so we do a 'AO = 1.0 - AO/128.0'
to kind-of reverse it. The result is written to the output buffer. Note that we take
the AO to the power of 2 before writing it out. This simply makes it look a bit better in my
opinion. This is another artist variable you may want to play with in your engine.

    This is an example of a very simple blur technique. The VS is actually identical to the
    one from the SSAO. In the fragment shader we sample 16 points around the origin and average

I haven't included the entire lighting shader since the change is very minor.
The ambient color is modulated by the ambient occlusion term sampled from the AO map for
the current pixel. Since we are rendering the actual geometry here and not a full screen quad
we have to calculate the texture coordinates using the system maintained gl_FragCoord. gShaderType
is a user controlled variable that helps us switch from SSAO to no-SSAO and only-ambient-occlusion-term
display. Play with the 'a' key to see how it goes.
