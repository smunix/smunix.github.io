            <h3> Background </h3>
<p>
    In this tutorial we are going to leave 3D for a while and focus on adding something
    practical and useful to our programs. We will learn how to integrate a user interface
    library which will help in configuring the various values that
    interest us in the tutorials. The library that we will use is called <i>Ant Tweak Bar</i> (a.k.a ATB)
    which is hosted at <a href="http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/">anttweakbar.sourceforge.net</a>.
    There are many options available and if you do some research on the subject you will find
    a lot of discussions and opinions on the matter. In addition to OpenGL, ATB also 
    supports DirectX 9/10/11 so if you want your UI to be
    portable this is a good advantage. I found it to be very useful and easy to
    learn. I hope you will too. So let's jump right in.
</p>
<p>
    <b><font color='red'>
    Disclaimer: as I was putting the finishing touches on this tutorial I noticed that ATB is no longer supported. The official website
    is alive but the author states that he is no longer actively maintaining it. After some thought I decided to publish this tutorial 
    regardless. The library has proved to be very useful to me and I plan to keep using it. If you are looking for something like that
    and having the library being actively maintained is a requirement for you then you may need to find an alternative but I think
    many people can use it as it is. Since this is open source there is always a chance someone will pick up maintenance.
    </b></font>
 </p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
    The first thing we need to do is to install ATB. You can grab the <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/anttweakbar/files/latest/download?source=dlp>zip file</a>
    from the ATB website (version 1.16 when this tutorial was published) which contains
    almost everything you need or use a copy of the files that I provide along with the
    tutorials source package. If you decide to go with the official package simply grab it
    from the link above, unzip it somewhere and grab AntTweakBar.h from the include directory and copy it
    where your project sees it. On Linux I recommend putting it in /usr/local/include (requires root access). In the
    tutorials source package this file is available under Include/ATB. 
</p>
<p>
    Now for the libraries.
    If you are using Windows this is very easy. The official zip file contains a lib directory
    with AntTweakBar.dll and AntTweakBar.lib (there is also a matching couple for 64 bits). You
    will need to link your project to the lib file and when you run the executable have the dll
    in the local directory or in Windows\System32. On Linux you will need to go into the src directory
    and type 'make' to build the libraries. The result will be libAntTweakBar.a, libAntTweakBar.so and
    libAntTweakBar.so.1. I recommend you copy these into /usr/local/lib to make them available from everywhere.
    The tutorials source package contains the Windows libraries in Windows/ogldev/Debug and the Linux binaries
    in Lib (so you don't need to build them).
</p>
<h3>Integration</h3>
<p>
    In order to use ATB you will need to include the header AntTweakBar.h in your source code:
    <code>
        <br>#include &lt;AntTweakBar.h&gt;
    </code>
    If you are using the Netbeans project that I provide then the Include/ATB directory which
    contains this header is already in the include path. If not then make sure your build system
    sees it.
</p>
<p>
    To link against the libraries:
    <ul>
        <li>Windows: add the AntTweakBar.lib to your Visual Studio project</li>
        <li>Linux: add '-lAntTweakBar' to the build command and make sure the Linux
            binaries are in /usr/local/lib</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Again, if you are using my Visual Studio or Netbeans projects then all of this
    is already set up for you so you don't need to worry about anything.    
</p>
<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p>
    In order to initialize ATB you need to call:
<code>
    <br>
    TwInit(TW_OPENGL, NULL);
</code>
    or in case you want to initialize the GL context for core profile:    
    <code>
        <br>
    TwInit(TW_OPENGL_CORE, NULL);
    </code>
    For the tutorials series I created a class called ATB which encapsulates some 
    of the functionality of the library and adds some stuff to make it easier for integration (that 
    class is part of the Common project).
    You can initialize ATB via that class using a code similar to this:
    <code>
        <br>
        ATB m_atb;<br>
        <br>
        if (!m_atb.Init()) {<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; // error<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; return false;<br>
        }<br>
    </code>
</p>
<h3>Processing Events</h3>
<p>
    ATB provides widgets that allow you to modify their values in different ways. In some widgets you
    can simply type in a new value. Others are more graphical in nature and allows the use of the
    mouse in order to modify the value. This means that ATB must be notified on mouse and keyboard events
    in the system. This is done using a set of callback functions that ATB provides for each of the underlying
    windowing libraries it supports (glut, glfw, SDL, etc). If your framework is based on just one of these
    libraries you can simply hook ATB's callbacks inside your callbacks. See ATB website for an example. Since OGLDEV supports both glut
    and glfw I'm going to show you how I integrated the callbacks into my framework so that these two libraries
    are supported in a unified manner. Take a look at the following three functions from the ATB class:    
</p>
<code>
bool ATB::KeyboardCB(OGLDEV_KEY OgldevKey)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     int ATBKey = OgldevKeyToATBKey(OgldevKey);<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     if (ATBKey == TW_KEY_LAST) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;         return false;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     }<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     return (TwKeyPressed(ATBKey, TW_KMOD_NONE) == 1);<br>
}<br>
<br>
<br>
bool ATB::PassiveMouseCB(int x, int y)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     return (TwMouseMotion(x, y) == 1);<br>
}<br>
<br>
<br>
bool ATB::MouseCB(OGLDEV_MOUSE Button, OGLDEV_KEY_STATE State, int x, int y)<br>
{    <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwMouseButtonID btn = (Button == OGLDEV_MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT) ? TW_MOUSE_LEFT : TW_MOUSE_RIGHT;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwMouseAction ma = (State == OGLDEV_KEY_STATE_PRESS) ? TW_MOUSE_PRESSED : TW_MOUSE_RELEASED;<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     return (TwMouseButton(ma, btn) == 1);<br>
}
</code>
<p>
    These functions are basically wrappers around the native ATB callback functions. They translate
    OGLDEV types to ATB types and then pass the call down to ATB. They return true if ATB processed the
    event (in which case you can simply discard it) and false if not (so you should take a look at
    the event and see if it interests you). Here's how I hooked these functions into the callbacks of
    the tutorial:     
</p>
<code>
    virtual void KeyboardCB(OGLDEV_KEY OgldevKey, OGLDEV_KEY_STATE OgldevKeyState)<br>
    {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         if (OgldevKeyState == OGLDEV_KEY_STATE_PRESS) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             if (m_atb.KeyboardCB(OgldevKey)) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                 return;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         }<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;              switch (OgldevKey) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;              .<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;              .<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;              .<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;                  default:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;                      m_pGameCamera->OnKeyboard(OgldevKey);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;              }<br>
    }<br>
<br>
<br>
    virtual void PassiveMouseCB(int x, int y)<br>
    {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;          if (!m_atb.PassiveMouseCB(x, y)) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;              m_pGameCamera->OnMouse(x, y);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;          }        <br>
    }<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    virtual void MouseCB(OGLDEV_MOUSE Button, OGLDEV_KEY_STATE State, int x, int y)<br>
    {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;          m_atb.MouseCB(Button, State, x, y);<br>
    }    
</code>
<p>
   If you are not familiar with OGLDEV framework then the above may not make much sense to you so
   make sure you spend some time with the tutorials first and get to know how things are done. Every
   tutorial is just a class that inherits from ICallbacks and OgldevApp. ICallbacks provides the (not surprisingly)
   callback functions that are called from the backend (by glut or glfw). We first let ATB know about the events
   and if it didn't process them we let the app handle them (e.g passing them on to the camera object).
 </p> 

<h3>Create a tweak bar</h3>
<p>
    You need to create at least one tweak bar which is basically a window with widgets
    that ATB provides to tweak your application:
    <code>
        <br>
    TwBar *bar = TwNewBar("OGLDEV");    
    </code>
    The string in the parenthesis is just a way to name the tweak bar. 
</p>
<h3>Draw the tweak bar</h3>
<p>
    In order for the tweak bar to appear in your OpenGL window there must be a call present
    to the TwDraw() function in the render loop. The ATB website provides the following
    generic render loop as an example:
    <code>
        <br>
    // main loop<br>
    while( ... )<br>
    {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         // clear the frame buffer<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         // update view and camera<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         // update your scene<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         // draw your scene<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         TwDraw();  // draw the tweak bar(s)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         // present/swap the frame buffer <br>
    } // end of main loop<br>
    </code>
    I placed a call to TwDraw() in the beginning of OgldevBackendSwapBuffers() (ogldev_backend.cpp:97).
    This function is called at the end of every main render function and is a good place
    to integrate TwDraw() into the framework.
</p>
<h3>Adding widgets</h3>
<p>
    The above is everything you need to basically have ATB up and running in your application.
    Your ATB bar should now look like this:
    <br><br>
    <img src="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial48/atb1.jpg">
    <br>
    From now on what we need to do is to add widgets and link them to our application
    so that they can be used to tweak parameters of our code.

    Let's add a drop down box. In this tutorial I will use it to select the mesh to
    be displayed. We need to use the TwEnumVal structure provided by ATB in order to create
    a list of available items in the drop down box. That structure is made of pairs of integer
    and a char array. The integer is an identifier for the drop down item and the
    char array is the name to be displayed. Once the item list is created as an array of TwEnumVal
    structs we create a TwType object using the TwDefineEnum function. TwType is an enum of a few
    parameter types that ATB understands (color, vectors, etc) but we can add user defined types 
    to support our specific needs. Once our TwType is ready we can use TwAddVarRW to link it
    to the tweak bar. TwAddVarRW() also takes an address of an integer where ATB will place 
    the current selection in the drop down box. We can then use that integer to change stuff
    in our application (the mesh to be displayed in our case).
    
    <code>
        <br>
        // Create an internal enum to name the meshes<br>
        typedef enum { BUDDHA, BUNNY, DRAGON } MESH_TYPE;    <br><br>
    // A variable for the current selection - will be updated by ATB<br>
    MESH_TYPE m_currentMesh = BUDDHA;<br><br>
    // Array of drop down items<br>
    TwEnumVal Meshes[] = { {BUDDHA, "Buddha"}, {BUNNY, "Bunny"}, {DRAGON, "Dragon"}};<br><br>
    // ATB identifier for the array<br>
    TwType MeshTwType = TwDefineEnum("MeshType", Meshes, 3);<br><br>
    // Link it to the tweak bar<br>
    TwAddVarRW(bar, "Mesh", MeshTwType, &m_currentMesh, NULL);<br><br>
    </code>
    The result should look like this:
    <br><br>
    <img src="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial48/atb2.jpg">
    <br>
    We can add a seperator using the following line:
    <code>
        <br>
        // The second parameter is an optional name<br>
    TwAddSeparator(bar, "", NULL);
    </code>
    Now we have:
    <br><br>
    <img src="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial48/atb3.jpg">
    <br>
    Let's see how we can link our camera so that its position and direction will always 
    be displayed. Until now you are probably already used to printing the current
    camera parameters so that they can be reused later but displaying them in the UI
    is much nicer. To make the code reusable I've added the function AddToATB() to the camera
    class. It contains three calls to ATB functions. The first call just uses TwAddButton()
    in order to add a string to the tweak bar. TwAddButton() can do much more and we will see
    an example later on. Then we have TwAddVarRW() that adds a read/write variable and
    TwAddVarRO() that adds a read-only variable. The read/write variable we use here
    is simply the position of the camera and the UI can be used to modify this and
    have it reflected in the actual application. Surprisingly, ATB does no provide an
    internal TwType for an array of three floats so I created one to be used by 
    the framework:
    <br><br>
    (ogldev_atb.cpp:38)
    <code>
        <br>    
        TwStructMember Vector3fMembers[] = {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;             { "x", TW_TYPE_FLOAT, offsetof(Vector3f, x), "" },<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;             { "y", TW_TYPE_FLOAT, offsetof(Vector3f, y), "" },<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;             { "z", TW_TYPE_FLOAT, offsetof(Vector3f, z), "" }<br>
        };<br>
        <br>
        TW_TYPE_OGLDEV_VECTOR3F = TwDefineStruct("Vector3f", Vector3fMembers, 3, sizeof(Vector3f), NULL, NULL);
    </code>
    We can now use TW_TYPE_OGLDEV_VECTOR3F whenever we want to add a widget to tweak a
    vector of 3 floats. Here's the complete AddToATB() function:
    <code>
        <br>
        void Camera::AddToATB(TwBar* bar)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddButton(bar, "Camera", NULL, NULL, "");                <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRW(bar, "Position", TW_TYPE_OGLDEV_VECTOR3F, (void*)&m_pos, NULL);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRO(bar, "Direction", TW_TYPE_DIR3F, &m_target, " axisz=-z ");<br>
}   
    </code>
    We have used the provided TW_TYPE_DIR3F as the parameter type that displays an array
    of 3 floats using an arrow. Note the addition of 'axisz=-z' as the last parameter
    of TwAddVarRO(). Many ATB functions take a string of options in the last parameter. This allows
    modifying the internal behavior of the function. axisz is used to change from right handed system (ATB default)
    to left handed system (OGLDEV default). There's a lot of additional options available that
    I simply cannot cover. You can find them <a href="http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/doc/tools:anttweakbar:varparamsyntax">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    Here's how the tweak bar looks with the camera added:
    <br><br>    
    <img src="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial48/atb4.jpg">
    <br>

    You are probably spending a lot of time playing with the orientation of your meshes. Let's add
    something to the tweak bar to simplify that. The solution is a visual quaternion that
    can be used to set the rotation of a mesh. We start by adding a local Quaternion variable (see ogldev_math_3d.h for
    the definition of that struct):
    <code>
        <br>
    Quaternion g_Rotation = Quaternion(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    </code>
    We then link the quaternion variable to the tweak bar using the parameter type TW_TYPE_QUAT4F:
    <code>
        <br>
    TwAddVarRW(bar, "ObjRotation", TW_TYPE_QUAT4F, &g_Rotation, " axisz=-z ");        
    </code>
    Again, we need to change from right handed to left handed system. Finally the quaternion
    is converted to degrees:
    <code>
        <br>
    m_mesh[m_currentMesh].GetOrientation().m_rotation = g_Rotation.ToDegrees();
    </code>
    The rotation vector can now be used to orient the mesh and generate the WVP matrix for it:
    <code>
        <br>
    m_pipeline.Orient(m_mesh[m_currentMesh].GetOrientation());
    </code>
    Our tweak bar now looks like this:
    <br><br>    
    <img src="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial48/atb5.jpg">
    <br>
    Now let's add a check box. We will use the check box to toggle between automatic
    rotation of the mesh around the Y-axis and manual rotation (using the quaternion we
    saw earlier). First we make an ATB call to add a button:
    
    <code>
        <br>
    TwAddButton(bar, "AutoRotate", AutoRotateCB, NULL, " label='Auto rotate' ");
    </code>
    The third parameter is a callback function which is triggered when the check box
    is clicked and the fourth parameter is a value to be transfered as a parameter to
    the callback. I don't need it here so I've used NULL.
    <code>
    <br>
    bool gAutoRotate = false;<br>
    <br>
    void TW_CALL AutoRotateCB(void *p)<br>
    { <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;     gAutoRotate = !gAutoRotate;<br>
    }
    </code>
        
    You can now use gAutoRotate to toggle between automatic and manual rotations.
    <br>
    Here's how the tweak bar looks like:
    <br><br>    
    <img src="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial48/atb6.jpg">
    <br>    
    Another useful widget that we can add is a read/write widget for controlling the speed
    of rotation (when auto rotation is enabled). This widget provides multiple ways to control
    its value:
<code>
    <br>    
    TwAddVarRW(bar, "Rot Speed", TW_TYPE_FLOAT, &m_rotationSpeed,<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                    " min=0 max=5 step=0.1 keyIncr=s keyDecr=S help='Rotation speed (turns/second)' ");
</code>
     The first four parameters are obvious. We have the pointer to the tweak bar, the string to display, the type of the parameter and the
     address where ATB will place the updated value. The interesting stuff comes in the option string at the end. First we
     limit the value to be between 0 and 5 and we set the increment/decrement step to 0.1. We set the keys 's' and 'd' to be shortcuts
     to increment or decrement the value, respectively. When you hover over the widget you can see the shortcuts in the bottom of the tweak
     bar. You can either type in the value directly, use the shortcut keys, click on the '+' or '-' icons on the right or use the lever to
     modify the value (click on the circle to bring up the rotation lever). Here's the bar with this widget: 
    <br><br>    
    <img src="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial48/atb7.jpg">
    <br>    
    In all of the tutorials there is usually at least one light source so it makes sense to add some code that will allow us to
    easily hook it up to the tweak bar so we can play with it parameters. So I went ahead and added the following methods to the
    various light source classes:
    <code>
        <br>
void BaseLight::AddToATB(TwBar *bar)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     std::string s = Name + ".Color";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRW(bar, s.c_str(), TW_TYPE_COLOR3F, &Color, NULL);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     s = Name + ".Ambient Intensity";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRW(bar, s.c_str(), TW_TYPE_FLOAT, &AmbientIntensity, "min=0.0 max=1.0 step=0.005");<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     s = Name + ".Diffuse Intensity";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRW(bar, s.c_str(), TW_TYPE_FLOAT, &DiffuseIntensity, "min=0.0 max=1.0 step=0.005");<br>
}<br>
<br>
<br>
void DirectionalLight::AddToATB(TwBar *bar)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     BaseLight::AddToATB(bar);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     std::string s = Name + ".Direction";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRW(bar, s.c_str(), TW_TYPE_DIR3F, &Direction, "axisz=-z");<br>
}<br>
<br>
<br>
void PointLight::AddToATB(TwBar *bar)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     BaseLight::AddToATB(bar);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     std::string s = Name + ".Position";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRW(bar, s.c_str(), TW_TYPE_OGLDEV_VECTOR3F, &Position, "axisz=-z");<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     s = Name + ".Attenuation";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRW(bar, s.c_str(), TW_TYPE_OGLDEV_ATTENUATION, &Attenuation, "");<br>
}<br>
<br>
<br>
void SpotLight::AddToATB(TwBar *bar)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     PointLight::AddToATB(bar);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     std::string s = Name + ".Direction";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRW(bar, s.c_str(), TW_TYPE_DIR3F, &Direction, "axisz=-z");<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     s = Name + ".Cutoff";<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;     TwAddVarRW(bar, s.c_str(), TW_TYPE_FLOAT, &Cutoff, "");<br>
}<br>
</code>         
    Note that 'Name' is a new string memeber of the BaseLight class that must be set before AddToATB() function
    is called on the light object. It represents the string that will be displayed in the tweak bar for that light.
    If you plan on adding multiple lights you must make sure to pick up unique names for them. AddToATB() is a virtual
    function so the correct instance according to the concrete class is always called. Here's the bar
    with a directional light source:

    <br>  
    The last thing that I want to demonstrate is the ability to get and set various parameters that control the behaviour 
    of the tweak bar. Here's an example of setting the refresh rate of the bar to one tenth of a second:
    <code>
        <br>
        float refresh = 0.1f;<br>
        <b>TwSetParam</b>(bar, NULL, "refresh", TW_PARAM_FLOAT, 1, &refresh);<br>
        </code>
    Since moving the mouse to the tweak bar means that the camera also moves I made the key 'a' automatically move the
    mouse to the center of the tweak bar without touching the camera. I had to read the location and size of the tweak bar
    in order to accomplish that so I used TwGetParam() in order to do that:
    <code>
        <br>
    virtual void KeyboardCB(OGLDEV_KEY OgldevKey)<br>
    {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;         if (!m_atb.KeyboardCB(OgldevKey)) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             switch (OgldevKey) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                 case OGLDEV_KEY_A:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                 {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                     int Pos[2], Size[2];<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                     <b>TwGetParam</b>(bar, NULL, "position", TW_PARAM_INT32, 2, Pos);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                     <b>TwGetParam</b>(bar, NULL, "size", TW_PARAM_INT32, 2, Size);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                     OgldevBackendSetMousePos(Pos[0] + Size[0]/2, Pos[1] + Size[1]/2);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                     break;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                 }
</code>
