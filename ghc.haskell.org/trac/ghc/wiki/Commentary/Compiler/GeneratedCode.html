<p>
The STG machine is an essential part of GHC, the world's leading
Haskell compiler. It defines how the Haskell evaluation model
should be efficiently implemented on standard hardware. Despite
this key role, it is generally poorly understood amongst GHC users.
This document aims to provide an overview of the STG machine in
its modern, eval/apply-based, pointer-tagged incarnation by a
series of simple examples showing how Haskell source code is
compiled.
</p>
<h2 id="WhatisSTGexactly">What is STG, exactly?</h2>
<p>
Haskell code being sucked through GHC has a complex lifecycle.
Broadly speaking, it transitions between five representations:

                                                                      |            ^
                                                                      |     +---+  | GCC
                                                            C backend \----&gt;| C |--/
                                                                            +---+

The path from C-- to assembly varies: the three possible backends
are C (<tt>-fvia-c</tt>), LLVM (<tt>-fllvm</tt>), and the default backend -- the
native code genarator (or NCG), which generates assembly directly
from the GHC-internal C-- data type.
</p>
<p>
STG is a simple functional language, rather like the more famous
Core language. It differs in the following main respects:
</p>
<ol><li>In its current incarnation, it isn't typed in the Haskell sense,
though it does know about <em>representation</em> types
</li><li>It is in administrative normal form (ANF), which is where every
subexpression is given a name
</li><li>Every $\lambda$, constructor application, and primitive operator
is $\eta$-expanded
</li><li>It is annotated with a ton of information that the code
generator is interested in knowing
</li></ol><p>
STG expressions can be one of the following:
</p>
<ol><li>Atoms (i.e. literals and variables)
</li><li><tt>let</tt>-bindings (both recursive and non-recursive) over another
expression, where let-bound things are one of:
<ul><li>A function value with explicit lambdas
</li><li>An unsaturated application
</li><li>A constructor applied to atoms
</li><li>A thunk (i.e. any expression not fitting into one of the above
categories)
</li></ul></li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Saturated primitive application of a primitive to variables
</li><li>Application of a variable to one or more atoms
</li><li>Case deconstruction of an expression, where each branch may also
be an expression
</li></ol><p>
The job of the <em>STG machine</em> is to evaluate these expressions in
a way which is efficiently implementable on standard hardware. This
document will look at how exactly this is achieved by looking at
real examples of the C-- code GHC generates for various Haskell
expressions.
</p>
<p>
This document will take a very low-level view of the machine, so if
you want to get comfortable with how the STG machine executes at a
more abstract level before reading this document, you might want to
read the paper
<a class="ext-link" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/eval-apply/"><span class="icon">​</span>How to make a fast curry: push/enter vs. eval/apply</a>.
It presents the STG machine without reference to an explicit stack
or registers, but instead as a transition system. This transition
system has also been implemented as a Haskell program called

see it in action on some simple examples.
</p>
<h2 id="AnoverviewoftheSTGmachine">An overview of the STG machine</h2>
<p>
Before we dive in, a note: this document will describe the STG
machine as it is implemented on x86-style architectures. I will use
the terms "the STG machine" and "the STG machine as implemented on
x86 by GHC" interchangeably. The implementation is somewhat
different on x64, not least due to the greater number of available
registers.
</p>
<p>
This overview section is rather bare. Readers might be able to fill
in any gaps in my explanation by using some of the following
sources:

</li></ul><h3 id="Componentsofthemachine">Components of the machine</h3>
<p>
In its bare essentials, the STG machine consists of three parts:
</p>
<ol><li>The STG registers:
<ul><li>There are rather a lot of registers here: more than can be
practicably stored in actual available processor registers on most
architectures.
</li><li>To deal with the lack of processor registers, most of the STG 
registers are actually kept on the stack in a block of memory
pointed to by a special STG register called the "base register" (or 
<tt>BaseReg</tt>). To get or set values of registers which are not kept in
processor registers, the STG machine generates an instruction to
load or store from an address relative to the <tt>BaseReg</tt>.
</li><li>The most important four registers are the <tt>BaseReg</tt>, the stack
pointer (<tt>Sp</tt>), the heap pointer (<tt>Hp</tt>), and the general purpose
register <tt>R1</tt> which is used for intermediate values, as well as for 
returning evaluated values when unwinding the stack. These are the 
four registers which are assigned actual processor registers when
implementing the STG machine on x86.
</li></ul></li><li>The STG stack:
<ul><li>Stores function arguments and continuations (i.e. the stack
frames which are executed when a function returns)
</li><li>Grows downwards in memory
</li><li>The top of the stack is pointed to by the STG register <tt>Sp</tt>, and 
the maximum available stack pointer is stored in <tt>SpLim</tt>. There is
no frame pointer.
</li></ul></li></ol><ol start="3"><li>The heap:
<ul><li>Used to store many different sorts of heap object: notably
functions, thunks and data constructors
</li><li>Grows upwards in memory, towards the stack
</li><li>All allocation occurs using a bump-allocator: the heap pointer is
simply incremented by the number of bytes desired (subject to to a
check that this does not exhaust available memory). The garbage
collector is responsible for moving objects out of the area of the 
heap managed by the bump allocator and into the care of its 
generational collector.
</li><li>The last address in the bump-allocated part of the heap that has 
been used is pointed to by the STG register <tt>Hp</tt>, with <tt>HpLim</tt>
holding the maximum address available for bump-allocation.
</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="Importantconceptsinthemachine">Important concepts in the machine</h3>
<p>
Some of the key concepts in the STG machine include <em>closures</em>,
<em>info tables</em> and <em>entry code</em>. We tackle them in reverse
order:
</p>
<dl class="wiki"><dt>Entry code</dt><dd>
The actual machine code that the STG machine will execute upon
"entry". Entry means different things for different heap objects.
</dd></dl>
<ul><li>For <em>thunks</em>, entry is when the thunk is forced by some demand
for its value, such as a <tt>case</tt> expression scrutinising it
</li><li>For <em>functions</em>, entry is when the function is applied to as
many arguments as are demanded by the arity recorded in its info
table
</li><li>For <em>continuations</em>, entry occurs when a value is returned from
a nested call, and hence the need arises to consume the value and
continue evaluation
</li></ul><dl class="wiki"><dt>Info table</dt><dd>
A block of memory allocated statically, which contains metadata
about a closure. The most important fields for our purposes are the
entry code pointer and the arity information (if this is the info
table for a thunk, function or partial application)
</dd></dl>
<dl class="wiki"><dt>Closure</dt><dd>
Essentially a heap-allocated pair of the free variables of some
code, and a pointer to its info table (i.e. its info pointer).
</dd></dl>
<p>
For an example of how these parts work together, consider the
following code
</p>
<pre class="wiki">my_fun x zs = map (\y -&gt; y + x) zs
</pre><p>
The nested lambda will give rise to all of the above objects.
</p>
<p>
The closure will store a pointer to <tt>x</tt>'s closure (as it is a free
variable of the lambda), along with a pointer to an info table.
That info table will contain information relevant to a function
value, recording information such as the fact that it has an arity
of 1 (i.e. the binding for <tt>y</tt>), and the pointer to the entry code
for the function <tt>\y -&gt; y + x</tt> itself. This entry code will
implement the addition by combining the closure for the free
variable <tt>x</tt> (taken from the closure) with the stack-passed <tt>y</tt>
variable's closure.
</p>
<p>
Upon entry to some code, pointers to closures are made available in
<tt>R1</tt>. That is to say, before entry code is jumped to, <tt>R1</tt> is set
up to point to the associated closure, so that the entry code can
access free variables (if any).
</p>
<p>
Closures for code which contain no free variables (such as the
closure for <tt>True</tt> and <tt>False</tt>, and functions applied to no
arguments such as <tt>(:)</tt> and <tt>id</tt>) are allocated statically by the
compiler in the same manner as info tables are.
</p>
<h3 id="Overviewofexecutionmodelofthemachine">Overview of execution model of the machine</h3>
<p>
This will be covered in more detail in the examples below, so I
will use this section to make some general points.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the STG machine is to reduce the current expression to
a value. When it has done so, it:
</p>
<ol><li>Stores a tagged pointer to evaluated closure in the STG register
<tt>R1</tt>
</li><li>Jumps to the entry code of the info table pointed to by the
value at the top of the STG stack
<ul><li>This may also be called the info table of the <em>continuation</em> of
the expression
</li></ul></li></ol><p>
The continuation code is responsible for popping its info pointer
(and stack-allocated free variables, if any) from the stack before
returning.
</p>
<p>
Arguments are passed on the stack, and are popped by the callee.
Upon a jump to the entry code for a function, there are always
precisely as many arguments on the stack as the (statically known)
arity of that function, and those arguments will be followed by the
info pointer of a continuation.
</p>
<h2 id="Saturatedapplicationtoknownfunctions">Saturated application to known functions</h2>
<p>
Handling application in the STG machine is a big topic, and so in
this first section we only look at the case of <em>saturated</em>
applications to <em>known</em> functions - i.e. those functions that the
compiler statically knows information such as the entry code
pointer and arity for.
</p>
<h3 id="Example1:functionapplicationwithsufficientstackspace">Example 1: function application with sufficient stack space</h3>
<p>
Application of functions is the bread and butter of the STG
machine. Correspondingly, this first Haskell program

The STG machine passes arguments to functions on the STG stack, and
a pointer to the stack top is stored in the STG register <tt>Sp</tt>.
Furthermore, because GHC currently uses the eval/apply variant of
the STG machine, exactly as many arguments as the function expects
to receive are guaranteed to present on the stack.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, upon entry to the <tt>known_app</tt> function, we are
guaranteed that the STG stack has a pointer to a closure of type
<tt>()</tt> on top of it. In order to call <tt>known_fun</tt>, we just modify the
top of the stack to replace that pointer with a pointer to the
statically allocated closure for the literal <tt>10</tt>, and then
tail-call into the entry code of <tt>known_fun</tt>.

As before, upon entry the STG stack is guaranteed to have a single
closure pointer at its top. However, in order to call into
known_fun_2 we need at least two free stack slots at the top for
arguments, which means that we have to grow the stack by one word
before we can make the call.
</p>
<h4 id="Checkingforsufficientstackspace">Checking for sufficient stack space</h4>
<p>
First, we check to see if growing the stack would overflow
allocated stack space, by comparing the STG stack pointer register
<tt>Sp</tt> with the stack limit register <tt>SpLim</tt>:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>Sp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> SpLim<span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">goto</span> clH<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div><p>
(The stack grows downwards, hence the <em>subtraction</em> of 4 from the
current <tt>Sp</tt>). If the stack check fails, we branch to <tt>clH</tt>:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="nl">clH:</span>
    R1 <span class="o">=</span> Main_knownzuappzu2_closure<span class="p">;</span>
    jump stg_gc_fun <span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div><p>
This stores the closure of the current function in <tt>R1</tt>, and then
jumps into the hand-written garbage collector code to force it to
grow the stack. After the stack has been grown, the collector will
call back into <tt>Main_knownzuappzu2_entry</tt> by using the information
stored in the (statically-allocated) <tt>Main_knownzuappzu2_closure</tt>
closure pointed to by <tt>R1</tt>, and the stack check will be run again -
hopefully succeeding this time!
</p>
<h4 id="Makingtheknowncall">Making the known call</h4>
<p>
Given that the stack check succeeds, it is easy to make the actual
call we are after. We simply grow the stack by the required amount,
and write the two arguments to <tt>known_fun_2</tt> into the top two stack
slots (overwriting our own first argument in the process, of
course):
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> stg_INTLIKE_closure<span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">209</span><span class="p">;</span>

The reason that there is no special magic to deal with
undersaturated applications to known functions is simple: GHC
simply gives <tt>known_undersaturated_app</tt> an arity of 2, so by the
time we jump to the entry code the stack must already contain any
arguments required by <tt>known_fun_2</tt>.

We aren't going to tackle oversaturated calls to known functions

</pre><p>
Unlike the previous cases we have looked at, we are compiling an
application where we don't statically know either the arity or the
info pointer of the function being applied. To deal with such
cases, the STG machine uses several pre-compiled "generic apply"
functions which inspect the info-table for the function in question
and decide how the available arguments should be applied to it.
</p>
<h3 id="Dealingwithgenericapplication">Dealing with generic application</h3>
<p>
There are three cases the generic apply functions have to deal
with:
</p>
<ol><li>The function's arity (recorder in the function closure's info
table) exactly matches the number of arguments available on the
stack
<ul><li>This is the best case. In this case, the generic apply function
simply makes a tail call into the function's entry code
</li></ul></li></ol><ol start="2"><li>The function's arity is greater than the number of arguments
available on the stack
<ul><li>In this case, the generic apply code allocates a PAP (partial
application) closure which closes over both the new arguments and
the function pointer, and returns that value, in the normal STGish
way, to the continuation on the top of the stack
</li></ul></li></ol><ol start="3"><li>The function's arity is less than the number of arguments
available on the stack
<ul><li>In this case, a number of arguments matching the arity are pushed
on top of the stack, followed by a continuation which uses another
of the generic apply functions to apply the remaining arguments.
The code for the original function is then entered
</li><li>Eventually the code for the continuation is entered and another
generic apply function will be tail-called to deal with the
result
</li></ul></li></ol><p>
Potentially, one generic apply function is required for every
"argument pattern". Some example argument patterns are:
</p>
<div class="document">
</div>
<p>
Because the number of patterns is large (actually unbounded,
because functions might be of any arity), GHC only generates
generic apply functions for enough patterns so that 99.9% of all
calls observed in practice have a generic apply function. Generic
apply functions for calls of larger arity can be simulated by
chaining together several smaller generic apply functions, in a
similar manner as when dealing with oversaturated function
applications.
</p>
<h3 id="Makingthecalltothegenericapplicationcode">Making the call to the generic application code</h3>
<p>
Let's remind ourselves of the original code:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    R1 <span class="o">=</span> I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">];</span>

    jump stg_ap_p_fast <span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div><p>
Knowing about generic apply functions, the call itself is easy to
understand. We pop the top of the stack (the function argument)
into <tt>R1</tt> and then jump into the generic application code for the
case where the stack contains a single pointer argument, which
deals with all the cases for <tt>f</tt> described above.

As you might see, despite being a call to a known function, this
code makes use of the generic apply functions we discussed in the
last section. Let's pick the function apart and see how it works.
</p>
<p>
First, we do the usual stack check. What differs from the last time
we saw this check is that we are not only allocating space for
arguments on the stack, but also for a <em>continuation</em>. We set up
these new stack entries as follows:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> stg_INTLIKE_closure<span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">209</span><span class="p">;</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> stg_ap_p_info<span class="p">;</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> base_GHCziBase_id_closure<span class="p">;</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> base_GHCziBase_id_closure<span class="p">;</span>
    Sp <span class="o">=</span> Sp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div><p>
i.e. the final stack looks as follows (note that the code
overwrites the old pointer to a closure of type ()):
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
 /----\    +---------------------------+
 | Sp |---&gt;| base_GHCziBase_id_closure |
 \----/    +---------------------------+
           | base_GHCziBase_id_closure |
           +---------------------------+
           |       stg_ap_p_info       |
           +---------------------------+
           |  stg_INTLIKE_closure+209  |
           +---------------------------+
           |           ...             |

</pre><p>
Because <tt>known_fun_2</tt> is of arity 2, when we jump to its entry
code, it will only consume the top two arguments from the stack:
i.e. the two pointers to <tt>base_GHCziBase_id_closure</tt>. It will then
evaluate to some sort of value and transfer control to the entry
code for <tt>stg_ap_p_info</tt>.
</p>
<p>
This is where the magic happens: the entry code for <tt>stg_ap_p_info</tt>
will apply the function value that was returned from <tt>known_fun_2</tt>
to the (pointer) argument in the "free variable" of its (stack
allocated) closure -- and we have arranged that that is
<tt>stg_INTLIKE_closure+209</tt>, i.e. the closure for the <tt>Int</tt> literal
<tt>10</tt>. This code is shared with the generic application functions
for calls to unknown functions, so this will make use of the
<tt>stg_ap_p_fast</tt> function we saw before.
</p>
<p>
Finally, control will be transferred back to the caller for
<tt>known_oversat_app</tt>, and all will be well.
</p>
<h2 id="Example6:allocationofthunksanddata">Example 6: allocation of thunks and data</h2>
<p>
Something that happens all the time in Haskell is allocation. There
are three principal types of thing that get allocated: function
closures, thunks, and data. These are all treated pretty much the
same in the STG machine for the simple reason that they share many
common characteristics:
</p>
<ul><li>Entry code which the STG machine jumps to, in order to evaluate
them
<ul><li>Note that for constructors, the entry code is trivial, as they
are always already evaluated! In this case, control will be
transferred directly back to the caller's continuation.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Free variables stored in a closure
<ul><li>For data, these "free variables" will be the values in the fields
of the particular data constructor
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Info-tables containing various miscellaneous metadata about the
heap object, such as function arity
</li></ul><p>
Let us look at how a thunk and a data constructor get allocated in
a simple setting:

<h3 id="Checkingforsufficientheapspace">Checking for sufficient heap space</h3>

Any function that needs to allocate memory might find that the heap
has been exhausted. If that happens, it needs to call into the
garbage collector in order to get the heap cleaned up and
(possibly) enlarged.

<p>
Hence, the first thing any such function does is check to see if
enough memory is available for its purposes:

</pre></div><p>
This is simple enough. The function needs to allocate 20 bytes (the
data constructor takes up 2 words, and the thunk will take up 3),
so it speculatively increments Hp and then checks the STG registers
<tt>Hp</tt> and <tt>HpLim</tt> (the pointer to the top of the available heap
space) against each other.
</p>
<p>
If memory is insufficient (i.e. we have moved <tt>Hp</tt> past the top of
the available heap), the code deals with it by setting the
<tt>HpAlloc</tt> register to the number of bytes needed and <tt>R1</tt> to the
closure for the function in which the heap check failed, before
jumping into the hand-written garbage collector code for the
cleanup. The garbage collector will resume execution of the code by
using the information from <tt>R1</tt>, after it has freed up enough
memory.
</p>
<p>
Side note: I believe that the line setting <tt>R1</tt> is unnecessary
here, because <tt>R1</tt> should anyway always be set to the address of
the closure when executing the closure entry code. I could be
wrong, though.
</p>
<h3 id="Performingtheactualallocation">Performing the actual allocation</h3>
<p>
Once the heap check succeeds, we will be able to enter the body of
the function proper. Since the <tt>Hp</tt> has already been incremented,
we can just construct the new heap objects directly:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    I32<span class="p">[</span>Hp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> slk_info<span class="p">;</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Hp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">];</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Hp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> base_DataziMaybe_Just_con_info<span class="p">;</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Hp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> Hp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div><p>
So we get something like this:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
            |              ...               |

</pre><p>
The bottom two words are the allocated <tt>Just</tt> value, and the three
above that correspond to the <tt>x + 1</tt> closure.
</p>
<h3 id="Returninganallocatedvaluetothecaller">Returning an allocated value to the caller</h3>
<p>
Now that we have allocated the data we entered the function in
order to construct, we need to return it to the caller. This is
achieved by the following code:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    R1 <span class="o">=</span> Hp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
    Sp <span class="o">=</span> Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
    jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div><p>
To return, the STG machine:
</p>
<ol><li>Sets <tt>R1</tt> to the pointer to the result of evaluation
</li><li>Pops all the arguments to the function from the stack
</li><li>Jumps to the entry code for the continuation. This is always
found at the top of the STG stack, logically below any arguments
that were pushed to make the call.
</li></ol><p>
This is indeed exactly what happens here, with two interesting
points: pointer tagging, and the double-deference of the stack
pointer. These will be discussed in the next two subsections.
</p>
<h4 id="Pointertagging">Pointer tagging</h4>
<p>
One exciting feature is that the code setting <tt>R1</tt>, i.e.
<tt>R1 = Hp - 2</tt>. This is setting <tt>R1</tt> to point to the <tt>Just</tt>, we just
allocated, but simultaneously tagging that pointer with the value
</p>
<ol start="2"><li>The fact that the tag is non-zero indicates to users of the
</li></ol><p>
pointer that the thing pointed to is already evaluated.
Furthermore, because <tt>Maybe</tt> has only two constructors, we are able
to use the pointer tags to record which constructor it evaluated
to: in this case, the 2 indicates the <tt>Just</tt> constructor.
</p>
<p>
It is compulsory to tag pointers before jumping to the address of
the continuation entry code: the entry code can and will rely on
those tags being present!
</p>
<h4 id="TABLES_NEXT_TO_CODE"><tt>TABLES_NEXT_TO_CODE</tt></h4>
<p>
Because I have compiled GHC without <tt>TABLES_NEXT_TO_CODE</tt>, the
entry code for the continuation is found by dereferencing the
pointer to the info table we found at the top of the STG stack -
i.e. a double-dereference.
</p>
<p>
The layout of heap objects without <tt>TABLES_NEXT_TO_CODE</tt> is as
follows:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
          Closure             Info table        Entry code
       +--------------+    +--------------+   +------------+
 x ---&gt;| Info pointer |---&gt;| Code pointer |--&gt;|    ...     |
       +--------------+    +--------------+
       |  .. FVs ..   |    |     ...      |

</pre><p>
With <tt>TABLES_NEXT_TO_CODE</tt> on, the situation looks more like this:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
          Closure          | .. Info table .. |
       +--------------+    +------------------+
 x ---&gt;| Info pointer |---&gt;| .. Entry code .. |
       +--------------+    |                  |
       |  .. FVs ..   |

</pre><p>
The <tt>TABLES_NEXT_TO_CODE</tt> optimisation removes the need for that
second dereference during the return, because the entry code is
always right next to the info table. However, it requires special
support from the backend for ensuring that data (i.e. the info
table) and code are contiguous in memory, so it cannot always be
used.

Notice that GHC has generated <em>two</em> functions:
<tt>Main_casezuscrut_entry</tt> and <tt>scj_ret</tt> correspond to the code for
forcing the argument to the <tt>case</tt>, and for the <em>continuation</em> of
the <tt>case</tt> respectively. Let's pick them apart and see how they
work!
</p>
<h3 id="Forcingthescrutineeofthecase">Forcing the scrutinee of the <tt>case</tt></h3>
<p>
When we first call the <tt>case_scrut</tt> function, its entry code begins
executing:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="nl">ccx:</span>
    R1 <span class="o">=</span> I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">];</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> scj_info<span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>R1 <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">goto</span> ccA<span class="p">;</span>
    jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>R1<span class="p">]])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nl">ccA:</span>
    jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>scj_info<span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div><p>
This is a function of arity 1 (i.e. with a single argument), so
upon entry the machine state looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
  /----\     +--------------------------+
  | R1 |----&gt;| Main_casezuscrut_closure |
  \----/     +--------------------------+

  /----\     +------------+
  | Sp |----&gt;|     x      |
  \----/     +------------+
             |    ...     |

</pre><p>
Because this is a top level function, the closure is statically
allocated and contains no free variables. However, as discussed
previously, the single argument to the function is guaranteed to be
present at the top of the stack.
</p>
<p>
The code starts off by saving this argument (the <tt>x</tt>) temporarily
into <tt>R1</tt>:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="nl">ccx:</span>
    R1 <span class="o">=</span> I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">];</span>
</pre></div><p>
The next thing the code does is overwrites this argument on the
stack with a pointer to the info-table of the continuation code.
This is the code that will be invoked after <tt>x</tt> has been evaluated
into WHNF, and which will do the test to decide whether to continue
as the <tt>Nothing</tt> or as the <tt>Just</tt> branch of the case:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> scj_info<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div><p>
As we saw earlier, any time that the STG machine decides that it
has a value in its hand, it will continue evaluation by
tail-calling the entry code found by dereferencing the info-table
pointer at the top of the stack. So by putting the address of our
continuation in here, we ensure that the entry code for <tt>scj_info</tt>
is executed after <tt>x</tt> becomes a value.
</p>
<p>
Now, what we need to do is to start the evaluation of <tt>x</tt>. We could
just jump into <tt>x</tt>'s entry code and hope for the best, but thanks
to GHC's pointer tagging we can sometimes avoid doing this indirect
branch.
</p>
<p>
So, instead, we test to see if the <tt>x</tt> pointer has a tag. If it is
tagged, then we know that it is already evaluated and hence jump
directly to the code for the continuation. If it is not tagged, we
are forced to make the jump into the entry code for <tt>x</tt>. This
choice is embodied by the following code:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>R1 <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">goto</span> ccA<span class="p">;</span>
    jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>R1<span class="p">]])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nl">ccA:</span>
    jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>scj_info<span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div><p>
Note the test <tt>R1 &amp; 3 != 0</tt>: this reflects the fact that pointer
tags are stored in the lower 2 bits of the pointer on 32 bit
machines. Another interesting feature is how the <tt>jump</tt>
instructions find the entry code: again, we see a deference of the
info pointer because <tt>TABLES_NEXT_TO_CODE</tt> is turned off.
</p>
<p>
As we saw, the <tt>case</tt> scrutinisation code ended with one of two
things happening: 1. A direct call into the continuation code
<tt>scj_ret</tt> if the scrutinee was already evaluated 2. A call into the
entry code for the scrutinee, if the scrutinee was not evaluated
(or it <em>was</em> evaluated, but the pointer was somehow not tagged
with that information) - Because we pushed <tt>scj_info</tt> onto the STG
stack, control will eventually return to <tt>scj_ret</tt> after the
evaluation of <tt>x</tt> has finished
</p>
<p>
It is now time to examine the continuation code to see what happens
after <tt>x</tt> becomes a value.
</p>
<h3 id="Dealingwiththeforcedscrutinee">Dealing with the forced scrutinee</h3>
<p>
The continuation code is a little more complicated:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="nl">cct:</span>
    _ccu<span class="o">::</span>I32 <span class="o">=</span> R1 <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nl">ccv:</span>
    R1 <span class="o">=</span> I32<span class="p">[</span>R1 <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">];</span>
    Sp <span class="o">=</span> Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
    R1 <span class="o">=</span> R1 <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span>
    jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>R1<span class="p">]])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div><p>
Whenever the STG machine evaluates to a value it will return the
value by jumping to the entry point at the top of the stack. In
this case, <tt>R1</tt> is guaranteed to be a (tagged) pointer to the thing
that was just evaluated. Because we are scrutinising a <tt>Maybe</tt> type
(which has fewer than 4 constructors) the code for the <tt>case</tt>
continuation is able to use the tag bits on the returned pointer to
decide which of the two branches to take:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="nl">cct:</span>
    _ccu<span class="o">::</span>I32 <span class="o">=</span> R1 <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>_ccu<span class="o">::</span>I32 <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">goto</span> ccv<span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div><p>
If we were scrutinising a data type with more constructors, the tag
bits would only tell us that the thing was evaluated, not which
constructor it was evaluated to. In this case, we would have to
read the constructor tag by dereferencing <tt>R1</tt> and testing the
resulting info table pointer against all possibilities.
</p>
<p>
If the tag was greater than or equal to 2, we go to the <tt>ccv</tt>
branch, which deals with what happens if we had a <tt>Just</tt>. In this
case, we need to continue by forcing the thunk inside the <tt>Just</tt>
and returning that value to our caller, which is what these lines
are doing:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="nl">ccv:</span>
    R1 <span class="o">=</span> I32<span class="p">[</span>R1 <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">];</span>
    Sp <span class="o">=</span> Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
    R1 <span class="o">=</span> R1 <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span>
    jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>R1<span class="p">]])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div><p>
To access the thing inside the <tt>Just</tt>, the code assumes that the
<tt>R1</tt> pointer is tagged with the 2 that indicates a <tt>Just</tt>
constructor, and hence finds the first free variable (stored 4
bytes into the closure) using <tt>I32[R1 + 2]</tt>, which is then saved
into <tt>R1</tt>. It pops the address of <tt>scj_info</tt> that was pushed onto
the stack in <tt>Main_casezuscrut_entry</tt> by moving <tt>Sp</tt> up 4 bytes
(remember that the STG stack grows downwards) and then untags and
jumps into the entry code for the <tt>R1</tt> thunk, using the same
double-dereference pattern discussed earlier.
</p>
<p>
There seems to be a small missed opportunity here: the code could
check the pointer tag on <tt>R1</tt>, and then return directly if it is
set. I imagine that this isn't being done in order to reduce
possible code bloat.
</p>
<h2 id="Example8:thunksandthunkupdate">Example 8: thunks and thunk update</h2>
<p>
You might be wondering how the <tt>x + 1</tt> thunk we saw allocated in a
previous section will behave when it is actually forced. To remind
you, the thunk we saw was constructed by the following Haskell
code:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">build_data :: Int -&gt; Maybe Int
build_data x = Just (x + 1)

So how does the <tt>x + 1</tt> thunk work? An excellent question! Let's

The original Haskell code read <tt>x + 1</tt>, but GHC has inlined the
actual code for the addition operation on <tt>Int</tt>s, which looks
something like:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">plusInt (I# a) (I# b) = I# (a + b)
</pre><p>
The second pattern match (to get <tt>b</tt>) has been performed statically
by GHC, obtaining the machine literal 1, which shows up directly in
the generated code. Therefore, the code only need to evaluate and
case-decompose the unknown free variable <tt>x</tt> of our closure, to get
the <tt>a</tt> argument to <tt>plusInt</tt>.
</p>
<h3 id="Thunkentrypoint">Thunk entry point</h3>
<p>
This evaluation is what is being done by the thunk entry code
<tt>slk_entry</tt>. Ignoring the stack check, the C-- begins thusly:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> stg_upd_frame_info<span class="p">;</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> R1<span class="p">;</span>
    R1 <span class="o">=</span> I32<span class="p">[</span>R1 <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">];</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Sp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> soN_info<span class="p">;</span>
    Sp <span class="o">=</span> Sp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div><p>
Remembering that upon entry to the thunk entry code, <tt>R1</tt> points to
the thunk's closure, the new stack looks as follows:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
 /----\    +---------------------+
 | Sp |---&gt;|       soN_info      |
 \----/    +---------------------+
           | stg_upd_frame_info  |
           +---------------------+     +-------------+
           | (thunk closure ptr) |----&gt;|   slk_info  |
           +---------------------+     +-------------+
           |        ...          |     | (undefined) |
                                       +-------------+
                                       |      x      | Free variable of thunk
                                       +-------------+
</pre><p>
The C-- statement <tt>R1 = I32[R1 + 8]</tt> is pulling out the pointer to
the free variable of the thunk (which was set up in
<tt>Main_buildzudata_entry</tt>) into <tt>R1</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the entry code evaluates that free variable (checking the
tag bits of the pointer first, as usual):
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>R1 <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">goto</span> cpk<span class="p">;</span>
    jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>R1<span class="p">]])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nl">cpk:</span> jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>soN_info<span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div><p>
Because we put <tt>soN_info</tt> at the top of the stack, when evaluation
of <tt>x</tt> is complete the STG machine will continue by executing the
<tt>soN_ret</tt> code.
</p>
<p>
The most interesting feature of this code is the extra stuff that
has been pushed onto the stack below <tt>soN_ret</tt>: an info pointer
called <tt>stg_upd_frame_info</tt>, and a pointer to the thunk currently
being evaluated.
</p>
<p>
This is all part of the STG machine's thunk update mechanism. When
the <tt>soN_ret</tt> continuation returns, it will transfer control
<em>not</em> to the code forcing the thunk, but to some code which
overwrites the contents of the current thunk closure with a closure
representing an "indirection". The entry code for such an
indirection closure is trivial: it immediately returns a pointer to
the thing that was returned from the <tt>soN_ret</tt> continuation in
<tt>R1</tt>.
</p>
<p>
These indirections are the mechanism which ensures that the STG
machine never repeats the work of evaluating a thunk more than
once: after the first evaluation, any code forcing the thunk jumps
into the indirection entry code rather than <tt>slk_entry</tt>.
</p>
<p>
That being said, let us look at how the continuation responsible
for actually finding the value of <tt>x + 1</tt> works:
</p>
<h3 id="Continuationofthethunk">Continuation of the thunk</h3>
<p>
Upon entry to the continuation code, we have the evaluated <tt>x</tt> in
<tt>R1</tt>: it now needs to do the addition and allocate a <tt>I#</tt>
constructor to hold the result of the addition. Because of the
allocation, <tt>soN_ret</tt> begins with a heap check. Ignoring that
check, we have the following code:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    _soL<span class="o">::</span>I32 <span class="o">=</span> I32<span class="p">[</span>R1 <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Hp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> ghczmprim_GHCziTypes_Izh_con_info<span class="p">;</span>
    I32<span class="p">[</span>Hp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> _soL<span class="o">::</span>I32<span class="p">;</span>
    R1 <span class="o">=</span> Hp <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
    Sp <span class="o">=</span> Sp <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
    jump <span class="p">(</span>I32<span class="p">[</span>stg_upd_frame_info<span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div><p>
This is mostly standard stuff. Because the <tt>R1</tt> pointer is
guaranteed tagged, and there is only one possible constructor, the
tag must be 1 and so the <tt>Int#</tt> value inside the <tt>Int</tt> is pulled
out using <tt>I32[R1 + 3]</tt>. This is then put into a newly
heap-allocated <tt>I#</tt> constructor, which is returned in <tt>R1</tt> after we
pop the <tt>soN_info</tt> pointer from the stack.
</p>
<p>
The only interesting point is where we return to: rather than
dereference <tt>Sp</tt> to find the info pointer at the top of the STG
stack, GHC has generated code that takes advantage of the fact that
the <tt>Sp</tt> is guaranteed to point to <tt>stg_upd_frame_info</tt>. This
avoids one pointer dereference.
</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This document has left much of the detail of how STG is implemented
out: notable omissions include CAFs, and the precise behaviour of
the garbage collector. Nonetheless, my hope is that it has helped
you to gain some more insight into the weird and wonderful way the
Haskell evaluation model is implemented.
