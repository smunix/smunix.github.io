<ul>
<li><p>Homework assignments are due by the <em>beginning of class</em> (1:30 pm) each Monday.</p></li>
<li><p>Late homework will be accepted with a penalty of 2 points (out of a total of 20) per day (or partial day). For example, homework may be submitted up to 1:30pm on Tuesday for a 2 point penalty, 1:30pm on Wednesday for a 4 point penalty, and so on. Note that the same penalties apply to revisions as well as initial submissions.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="collaborationacademic-honesty">Collaboration/academic honesty</h2>
<p>Collaboration on homework is encouraged. You are also free to consult any outside sources such as tutorials, books, or wikis, and to seek help from sources such as the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel">#haskell IRC channel on freenode</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell">StackOverflow</a> (though your first stop for questions should be <a href="http://piazza.com/upenn/spring2013/cis194">piazza</a>).</p>
<p>However, the following restrictions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Homework solutions <em>must be written individually</em>. Copying of any portions of code is strictly forbidden.</p></li>
<li><p>You <em>must cite</em> any people or resources you consulted in completing an assignment. For example, at the top of an assignment you might write something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I collaborated with Grace Hopper and Moses Sch√∂nfinkel on this assignment, received help from <code>edwardk</code> in <code>#haskell</code>, and consulted <code>http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Combinatory_logic</code> and <code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14585220/understanding-a-rank-2-type-alias-with-a-class-constraint</code>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Academic dishonesty of any form will not be tolerated, and will typically result in a score of zero on the assignments in question, at the very least.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Each homework assignment is graded on the following scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>a maximum of 15 points for correctness</li>
<li>a maximum of 5 points for style</li>
</ul>
<p>A revised version of each assignment may be submitted by the due date of the subsequent assignment. The final grade on an assignment is computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>average</em> of the initial and revised correctness scores, plus</li>
<li>the <em>maximum</em> of the initial and revised style scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final grades will computed as a weighted average:</p>
<ul>
<li>75% homework</li>
<li>25% final project</li>
</ul>
