% Performance

# Nomen est numen: "to name is to know"

When I got my start working in Haskell (back in the previous
millennium), it felt like a kind of miracle that this magic we were
writing could be executed at all.

Nowadays, I feel a little cheated if my code doesn't perform within a
small factor of C code.

We get from "it runs!" to "it's small and fast!" by measuring,
tweaking, and measuring again. And again.

And *again*.


# Measuring time and space

There are two aspects of performance that are of interest to us.

* How long does a program or function take?

* How much memory does it require?

Let's start with time.


# Computing the length of a list

An old favourite:

~~~~ {.haskell}
module Length where

len0 :: [a] -> Int
len0 (_:xs) = 1 + len0 xs
len0 _      = 0
~~~~

Yawn, right?

But how long does it take to run?


# Measuring time performance

The standard Haskell tool for timing measurement is a package named
criterion.

~~~~
cabal install criterion
~~~~

criterion makes it extremely easy to get a benchmark up and running.

~~~~ {.haskell}
import Criterion.Main
import Length

main = defaultMain [ bench "len0" $ whnf len0 [0..100000] ]
~~~~

If we compile this to an executable, we'll have a fully usable
benchmark program.


# The moving parts

The `defaultMain` function accepts a list of benchmarks to run.

It parses a standard set of command line arguments, then runs the
benchmarks.

The `bench` function describes a single benchmark.

* Its first argument is the name to print for the benchmark.

* The second is a description of the actual function to benchmark.

The `whnf` function describes *how* to run a benchmark.


# How to run a benchmark

criterion provides several ways to run a benchmark.

For pure functions:

* `whnf` accepts two arguments, a function and the last argument to
  pass to the function.  It supplies the argument to the function,
  then evaluates the result to weak head normal form (WHNF).
  
* `nf` is similar, but evaluates the result to normal form (NF).

For impure `IO` actions:

* `whnfIO` accepts an `IO` action, runs it, and evaluates the result
  to WHNF.

* `nfIO` accepts an `IO` action, runs it, and evaluates the result to
  NF.


# The ideal benchmarking environment, and the reality

Ideally, we'd always benchmark on a completely quiet machine with
predictable performance.

There are many reasons why this is not achievable, among them:

* CPU frequency changes in response to load and thermal stress

* Other processes (e.g. web browsers) contending for resources

* External interrupts, e.g. from mouse, network adapters

So are we doomed?


# A sanity check

While we can't directly observe sources of measurement interference,
we *can* detect interference that perturbs our measurements.

If the interference is moderate to severe, it will perturb many
measurements, and criterion will indicate that its measurements are
suspicious.


# What do we see?

The output of a criterion run:

~~~~

std dev: 183.9797 us, lb 151.8929 us, ub 242.1031 us, ci 0.950
~~~~


# Why scrutinize the clock so closely?

criterion works hard to be fully automatic.

It considers clock *resolution*, the smallest unit by which the
wallclock timer will increment.

Why?

* If a function takes on the order of the same amount of time (or
  less) to evaluate, we must evaluate it many times to get a reliable
  measurement.

It also considers clock *cost*, i.e. how long it takes to ask the
clock the current time.


# Reporting numbers

What about these numbers?

~~~~
benchmarking len0
mean: 1.490665 ms, lb 1.458564 ms, ub 1.531022 ms, ci 0.950
std dev: 183.9797 us, lb 151.8929 us, ub 242.1031 us, ci 0.950
~~~~

How come we're giving bounds (`lb` and `ub`) on the mean and standard
deviation?

Measuring is a noisy business.  These are estimates of the range
within which 95% of measurements are falling.


# Space measurements at a glance

We can get a great start by building our programs with the `-rtsopts`
option. This allows us to pass extra options to GHC's runtime system
when we run our compiled program.

Suppose we want to see the space performance of this program.

~~~~ {.haskell}
import Control.Monad (forM_)
import Data.List (sortBy)
import Data.Ord (comparing)
import System.Environment (getArgs)
import qualified Data.Map as M

main = do
  args <- getArgs
  forM_ args $ \f -> do
    ws <- words `fmap` readFile f
    forM_ (sortBy (comparing snd) . M.toList .
           foldl (\m w -> M.insertWith (+) w 1 m) M.empty $ ws) $
          \(w,c) -> putStrLn $ show c ++ "\t" ++ w
~~~~

We compile it with the following command line:

~~~~
ghc -O -rtsopts --make WordFreq.hs
~~~~


# GC summary statistics

The `+RTS` command line option begins a series of RTS options.  The
RTS will hide these from our program.

The `-RTS` option ends the series of RTS options.  (We can omit it if
RTS options are the last thing on the command line.)

~~~~
./WordFreq foo.txt +RTS -s -RTS
~~~~

The `-s` RTS option tells the runtime to print summary statistics from
the memory manager.


# What do GC summary statistics look like?

~~~~
   160,394,496 bytes allocated in the heap

# Stats, part 1 of 4

Let's break it all down, from top to bottom.

~~~~
   160,394,496 bytes allocated in the heap
   104,813,280 bytes copied during GC
    15,228,592 bytes maximum residency (9 sample(s))
       328,112 bytes maximum slop
	    36 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)
~~~~

Key statistics to look at:

* `allocated in the heap`: total memory allocated during entire run

* `copied during GC`: amount of memory that had to be copied because
  it was alive
  
* `maximum residency`: largest amount of memory in use at one time


# Stats, part 2 of 4

Time spent in the garbage collector:

~~~~
				  Tot time (elapsed)  Avg pause  Max pause
Gen  0       297 colls,     0 par    0.10s    0.10s     0.0003s    0.0021s
Gen  1         9 colls,     0 par    0.08s    0.10s     0.0113s    0.0350s
~~~~

* GHC uses a generational GC, so we get a GC breakdown by generation.
  Gen 0 is the nursery.
  
* `par` is the number of GC passes that used multiple CPUs in parallel.


# Stats, part 3 of 4

Where the program spent its time:

~~~~
INIT    time    0.00s  (  0.00s elapsed)
MUT     time    0.12s  (  0.13s elapsed)
GC      time    0.18s  (  0.20s elapsed)
EXIT    time    0.00s  (  0.00s elapsed)
Total   time    0.31s  (  0.33s elapsed)
~~~~

* `INIT`: starting the program

* `MUT`: "mutation", the part where the program was doing useful work

* `GC`: garbage collection

* `EXIT`: shutdown

There are two columns of numbers in case we're running on multiple
cores.


# Stats, part 4 of 4

These are really the most useful numbers to look at:

~~~~
%GC     time      59.1%  (60.7% elapsed)

Alloc rate    1,280,768,615 bytes per MUT second

Productivity  40.9% of total user, 37.6% of total elapsed
~~~~

* If GC time is high and productivity is low, we're spending a lot of
  time doing GC, which leaves less for real work.
  
* Are the numbers above healthy?  NO!  

There were problems in our code - but what were they?


# Next step: basic heap profiling

Another standard RTS option:

~~~~
./WordFreq foo.txt +RTS -hT
~~~~

This generates a file named `WordFreq.hp`, which contains a *heap
profile*, a time-based snapshot of what was in the heap and when,
categorized by data constructor.

We can't easily read a heap profile, so we use `hp2ps` to convert it
to a PostScript file.

~~~~
hp2ps -c WordFreq.hp
~~~~

This will give us `WordFreq.ps`, which we can open in a suitable viewer.


# Heap profiler output

![Not so happy looking!](WordFreq-hT.png)

Clearly we're allocating a ton of cons cells, and half a ton of
thunks.


# Our program with its space leaks fixed

Does this heap profile look better?

![What a relief!](WordFreq2-hT.png)

It's still a similar shape, but look at the units on the *y* axis
above!

Also, check out the healthier GC summary stats:

~~~~
%GC     time      33.6%  (32.9% elapsed)

Alloc rate    1,246,782,295 bytes per MUT second

Productivity  66.4% of total user, 63.3% of total elapsed
~~~~


# Full heap profiling

Basic heap profiling is useful, but GHC supports a much richer way to
profile our code.

This richer profiling support has a space and time cost, so we don't
leave it turned on all the time.

To use it, we must compile both libraries and programs with `-prof`.

If you're using `cabal`, see the `--enable-library-profiling` and
`--enable-executable-profiling` options.

* As mentioned in an early lecture, simply leave `library-profiling`
  set to `True` in your `$HOME/.cabal/config`.

* With library profiling enabled, `cabal` will generate both normal
  and profiled libraries, and will use the right one at the right
  time.


# More about full heap profiling

The basics of full heap profiling are similar to what we saw with
`-hT` and `hp2ps` a moment ago.

The full profiler is a powerful facility, so it's worth reading
[the profiling chapter of the GHC manual](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.2.1/html/users_guide/profiling.html).

In particular, to get much out of the profiler, you'll need to know
about
[cost centres](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.2.1/html/users_guide/profiling.html#cost-centres),
which are annotated expressions used for book-keeping when profiling.

In many cases, you can simply use the `-auto-all` option to get GHC to
annotate *all* top-level bindings with cost centres.

You'll also want to use the
[`-P` RTS option](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.2.1/html/users_guide/prof-time-options.html),
which writes a human-readable time and space profile into a file
ending with a `.prof` extension.

* *Caveat lector*: adding too many cost centres to your code,
  particularly on hot code paths, will cause the profiler's
  book-keeping to perturb your performance!


# What about this?

Please enter the following definition into a source file, and load it
into `ghci`.

sum0 :: [Integer] -> Integer
sum0 (x:xs) = x + sum0 xs
sum0 _      = 0
~~~~

Now please tell me the result of this expression.

~~~~ {.haskell}
sum0 [0..9876543]
~~~~

Once you're done, please tell me the result of this expression.

~~~~ {.haskell}
sum0 [0..98765432]
~~~~


# Welcome to Core

Given our earlier definition of the function `len0`, suppose were to
try this on the command line:

~~~~
ghc -c -ddump-simpl Length.hs
~~~~

And we'll see GHC dump a transformed version of our code in a
language named *Core*.

~~~~ {.haskell}
Rec {
Length.len0 [Occ=LoopBreaker]
  :: forall a_abp. [a_abp] -> GHC.Types.Int
[GblId, Arity=1]
Length.len0 =
  \ (@ a_aov) (ds_dpn :: [a_aov]) ->
    case ds_dpn of _ {
      [] -> GHC.Types.I# 0;
      : ds1_dpo xs_abq ->
        GHC.Num.+
          @ GHC.Types.Int
          GHC.Num.$fNumInt
          (GHC.Types.I# 1)
          (Length.len0 @ a_aov xs_abq)
    }
end Rec }
~~~~


# What is Core?

Core is also known as System FC, a greatly simplified version of
Haskell that is used internally (in abstract form) by GHC.

Real Haskell code is compiled to Core, which is then transformed
repeatedly by various optimization passes.  These live in the
*simplifier*, roughly the middle of the compilation pipeline.

What we see with `-ddump-simpl` is a pretty-printed version of the
abstract Core representation after the simplifier has finished all of
its transformations.

Isn't Core scary?

* Not really. 

* Remember, the pretty-printed representation is basically just
  greatly simplified Haskell, with extra annotations that are really
  only interesting to the compiler.

Let's walk through some Core, for fun.


# From the outside in

~~~~ {.haskell}
Rec {
Length.len0 [Occ=LoopBreaker]
  :: forall a_abp. [a_abp] -> GHC.Types.Int
{- ... -}
end Rec }
~~~~

* `Rec { ... }` indicates that we're looking at a recursive binding.

* Notice that the `forall` that we're used to *not* seeing in Haskell
  is *explicit* in Core (bye bye, syntactic sugar!).

* Notice also that the type parameter named `a` in Haskell got renamed
  to `a_abp`, so that it's unique.
  
* If `a` crops up in a signature for another top-level function, it
  will be renamed to something different.  This "uniqueness renaming"
  can sometimes make following types a little confusing.
  
* Type names are fully qualified: `GHC.Types.Int` instead of `Int`.


# Function annotations

~~~~ {.haskell}
[GblId, Arity=1]
~~~~

* This is a global identifier, and is a function that takes one
  parameter.


# Type application

~~~~ {.haskell}
Length.len0 =
  \ (@ a_aov) (ds_dpn :: [a_aov]) ->
~~~~

The '@' annotation here is a *type application*: GHC is applying the
type `a_aov` (another renaming of `a`) to the function.

Type applications are of little real interest to us right here, but at
least we know what this notation is (and we'll see it again soon).


# Case analysis, part 1

~~~~ {.haskell}
    case ds_dpn of _ {
      [] -> GHC.Types.I# 0;
~~~~

This looks like regular Haskell.  Hooray!

Since that's hardly interesting, let's focus on the right hand side
above, namely this expression:

~~~~ {.haskell}
GHC.Types.I# 0
~~~~

The `I#` above is the value constructor for the `Int` type.

This indicates that we are allocating a boxed integer on the heap.


# Case analysis, part 2

~~~~ {.haskell}
      : ds1_dpo xs_abq ->
~~~~

Normal pattern matching on the list type's `:` constructor.  In Core,
we use prefix notation, since we've eliminated syntactic sugar.

~~~~ {.haskell}
        GHC.Num.+
          @ GHC.Types.Int
          GHC.Num.$fNumInt
~~~~

We're calling the `+` operator, applied to the `Int` type.

The use of `GHC.Num.$fNumInt` is a *dictionary*.

* It indicates that we are passing the `Num` dictionary for the `Int`
  type to `+`, so that it can determine which function to really call.

In other words, dictionary passing has gone from implicit in Haskell
to *explicit* in Core.  This will be really helpful!


# The actual parameters to +

Finally, we allocate an integer on the heap.

We'll add it to the result of calling `len0` on the second argument to
the `:` constructor, where we're applying the `a_aov` type again.

~~~~ {.haskell}
          (GHC.Types.I# 1)
          (Length.len0 @ a_aov xs_abq)
~~~~


# Strictness in Core

In System FC, all evaluation is controlled through `case` expressions.
A use of `case` demands that an expression be evaluated to WHNF,
i.e. to the outermost constructor.

Some examples:

~~~~ {.haskell}
-- Haskell:
foo (Bar a b) = {- ... -}

-- Core:
foo wa = case wa of _ { Bar a b -> {- ... -} }
~~~~

~~~~ {.haskell}
-- Haskell:
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}
let !a = 2 + 2 in foo a

-- Core:
case 2 + 2 of a { __DEFAULT -> foo a }
~~~~

~~~~ {.haskell}
-- Haskell:
a `seq` b

-- Core:
case a of _ { __DEFAULT -> b }
~~~~


# Pop quiz!

Inspect the output of `ghc -ddump-simpl` and tell me which values are,
and which are not, being forcibly evaluated in the definition of
`sum0`.

In return, I'll tell you why we got this error message:

~~~~
*** Exception: stack overflow
~~~~


# The evaluation stack

There is no such thing as a regular "call stack" in Haskell, no
analogue to the stack you're used to thinking of in C or Python or
whatever.

When GHC hits a `case` expression, and must evaluate a possibly
thunked expression to WHNF, it uses an internal stack.

This stack has a fixed size, which defaults to 8MB.

The size of the stack is fixed to prevent a program that's stuck in an
infinite loop from consuming all memory.

Most of the time, if you have a thunk that requires anywhere close to
8MB to evaluate, there's likely a problem in your code.


# The perils of chained thunks

There are a few ways in which chained thunks can cause us harm.

Besides stack overflows, I can think of two more problems off the top
of my head.

Please see if you can tell me what those problems are.


# The perils of chained thunks

There are a few ways in which chained thunks can cause us harm.

Besides stack overflows, I can think of two more problems off the top
of my head.

* They have a space cost, since they must be allocated on the heap.

* They come with a time cost, once evaluation to WHNF is demanded.


# So ... thunks are bad?

No, because they enable lazy evaluation.

What's bad is *not knowing* when lazy or strict evaluation is
occurring.

But now that you can read `-ddump-simpl` output and find those `case`
expressions, you'll be able to tell immediately.

With a little experience, you'll often be able to determine the
strictness properties of small Haskell snippets by inspection.  (For
those times when you can't, `-ddump-simpl` will still be your friend.)


# Pro tips

If you're using GHC 7.2 or newer and want to read simplifier output,
consider using options like `-dsuppress-all` to prevent GHC from
annotating the Core.

It makes the dumped Core more readable, but at the cost of information
that is sometimes useful.

There's a handful of these suppression options (see the GHC man page),
so you can gain finer control over suppressions.

Also, try installing and using the `ghc-core` tool to automate some of
the pain:

~~~~
cabal install ghc-core
~~~~


# The role of reading Core

I always reach for `-ddump-simpl` *after*:

* I already have a working program.

* I'm happy (in principle) with the algorithms and data structures I'm
  using.  *No amount of local tweaking of strictness is going to save
  me from the consequences of a poor choice of algorithm or data
  structure!*

* I've written QuickCheck tests, even if only one or two.

* I have measured the performance of my code and find it wanting.

A couple of minutes with simplifier output will help guide me to the
one or two strictness annotations I'm likely to really need.

This saves me from the common newbie mistake of a random splatter of
unnecessary strictness annotations, indicating a high level of panic
and lack of understanding.
