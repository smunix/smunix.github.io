It is generally agreed that formulating careful specifications of software is
a good idea, whether before or after the software is written. Specifications
improve software <i>design</i>, by revealing unclear behaviour or complicated
cases. Specifications guide <i>programming</i>, by offering an objective
criterion for whether a program is right or wrong. Specifications assist
<i>reuse</i>, by documenting exactly what software is supposed to do.

<p>
However, specifications are used much less in practice than one might
expect. Our goal in developing QuickCheck is to <i>add value to
specifications</i>, by offering a short-term payoff for their use. 

<ul>
<li>QuickCheck encourages you to formulate precise, formal specifications, in
Haskell, a language you already know. Like other formal specifications,
QuickCheck properties have an unambiguous and clear meaning.
<li>QuickCheck checks your program against the specification, by
testing. Although this cannot <i>guarantee</i> that the program and
specification are consistent, it greatly reduces the risk that they are
not. It is easy to recheck consistency after every change to a module.
<li>QuickCheck specifications <i>document</i> how you tested your program;
other programmers using your code can see which properties have been tested,
and which have not.
<li>QuickCheck reduces the time spent on testing, by generating many test
cases automatically. This saving can be set against the time spent on
formulating the specification in the first place.
</ul>
